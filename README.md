# Advent_of_Code
This has all my solution programs for Advent of Code 2021 (still a work in progress!). If you don't know what Advent of Code is, here you go: https://adventofcode.com. If you know it but haven't tried it out yet, I highly recommend that you do. The fun in it is unimaginable.

These are the programming languages I used in my solutions: 

i. Python -> Day 1, Day 3/A

ii. C++  -> Day 2

iii. Rust -> Day 3/B, Day 4
